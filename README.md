# project_2: Analysis of COVID-19 cases in Mexico.
Team members:Alfredo, Enrique, Hector, Jan

* Rationale: We decided to choose the topic of COVID-19 cases in Mexico due to the relevance of the current situation in the country.We want to contribute to a greater understanding of the virus spread throughout the country. 
* Data set: The data is updated daily, and we aim to track and find patterns that could explain how it spreads. The data is sourced from the Mexican government health authorities, which keep track of the confirmed and suspected cases around the country. CSV files of suspected, and confirmed cases, updated daily with new evidence. They contain fieldas as state, age, sex, number of confirmed cases, number of suspected cases, and number of deceased cases (among others).
* Visual ideas: visualization of data will be generated using Google Maps, and we will use Matplotlib to chart individual information and the relationship between some of the variables. We will also visualize prevalence using a color-intensity gradient. We will add filters for age, sex, provider (private versus public), etc.
Tools: We will use SQLite to create the database. Then, we will be using a combination of web scraping and Leaflet or Plotly.
