Project_2: Analysis of COVID-19 cases in Mexico

Team members: Alfredo Velarde, Enrique Gaspar, Hector Contreras, Jan Hogewoning

Objective: We decided to choose the topic of COVID-19 cases in Mexico due to the relevance of the current situation in the country. We want to contribute to a greater understanding of the virus spread throughout the country. 

Method: Our aim is to create a visual representation of the spread to different states in the country. This visual representation will allow the viewer to see the change over different days. It will allow the viewer to select a state and see different stats about the patients, for each day. This will include number of confirmed, number of suspected, number of deaths, age, underlying conditions (comorbid cases), patient admittance to hospital and ventilator delivered. On a national level, we will analyze the correlation between mortality and the variables underlying conditions, age, patient admittance to hospital and ventilator delivered.

The data is updated daily, and we aim to track and find patterns that could explain how it spreads. The data is sourced from the Mexican government health authorities, which keep track of the confirmed and suspected cases around the country. CSV files of suspected, and confirmed cases, updated daily with new evidence. They contain data including state, age, sex, number of confirmed cases, number of suspected cases, and number of deceased cases (among others).

Tools used: Visualization of data will be generated using Google Maps and a combination of web-scraping and Leaflet. We will visualize prevalence per state over time using a color-intensity gradient. We will add filters for age, sex, underlying conditions etc. and these will be visible in a marker. We will use Matplotlib to perform and chart correlation analyses.
